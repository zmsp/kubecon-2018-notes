#  The Art of Documentation for Open Source Projects - Ben Hall, Katacoda

* First thing to include: how will this project help/ relevancy, problem statement, benefits
* think of how can you showcase the project to the user w/o   large amount of commitment? (Video/Demo/Gif/Photo)
* Empower people to feel confident and build trust
* Include competitive advantage
* When including snippets of code include complete example. DO NOT assume that users will have prior knowledge
* tool: client library
* make it open and accessible as possible (not everyone speaks the same language)
* DONT include words like "just", "easy", "simple", "anyone can do this" people may feel discouraged when struggling.
* split documentation for beginner/proficient/expert
* how do you make sure the user can find the right documentation?
  - break down documentation. Don't put everything on the same page
* keep in mind user emotions (users may be frustrated when there are large docs)
* FAQ to linked to documentation parts can be useful.
* Auto generating docs tools
  - in line documentation... tools can generate docs off it.
  - naturaldocs.org
  - pandoc
  - DOXYGEN
  - latex + addons
* encourage contribution -- have a guideline on how to contribute + include license. metrics show people will support
* ideal docs example? Leg
* add feedback form/rating (thumbs up/thumbs down)
* katacoda.com allows you to create docs/live demo, built in terminal.
